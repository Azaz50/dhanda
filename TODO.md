Every successful and failure operation will show success and error message and should be in green and red color respectively.

BUG: Party: Search: Searching party doesn't work at all on name.

BUG: Party: Search: When no match found the Error message is set as Success which should not, show "No matching result found" instead.

BUG: Party: Search: It is possible that multiple party matches the query but the code breaks out of loop after first match.

BUG: Txn: Add: Adding new transaction with party ID crashes the app (SIGSEGV). Found the bug at in file util.c at line 246 (if(party_findbyid(app, *pid, result) == 1)). It is due to incorrect passing of result variable.

BUG: Txn: Add: Transaction Type is keep asking for input even thoug correct input is given. Bug in input_txn_type() function.

BUG: Txn: List: UI: Transaction show output is completely messed up

Transaction show screen should show the transaction detail as in Party Show screen.
